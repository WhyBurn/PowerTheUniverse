  buildingDescription: Tired of unknowingly pulling planets into each other because
    your buildings are too massive? These spheres can help with that! The antimatter
    that they contain reduces the net mass of planets, canceling out their gravitational
    pull. Just don't shake the sphere too much, we wouldn't want the matter exterior
    making contact with the antimatter interior, now would we.
