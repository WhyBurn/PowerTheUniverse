  descriptions:
  - Astral Avarice is a game about building a power company across a solar system
    in order to turn massive profits.
  - In the stats panel you can see your current income for both cash and advanced
    materials. You collect this each pay cycle, which occurs every 30 seconds.
  - Each mission has a goal income. If you maintain a cash income equal to or greater
    than the goal for 10 seconds, you will win the mission. If you have no money,
    and no income, or make it impossible to achieve the goal income, you will fail
    the mission.
  - Each system has many planets where you can build all different types of buildings
  - Houses exist in the world, and you deliver power to them to make money.
  - The building menu has different tabs for pylons, power plants, labs, and utility
    buildings.
  - Pylons are buildings that have more than one cable slot. This means you can connect
    a pylon to multiple buildings to make larger, more flexable grids.
  - Power plants produce power. This power goes through power lines to other buildings
    in order to power them. If connected to the same grid, power plants can add or
    split their power freely.
  - Some planets have resources, (coal, wind, solar, or thermal). These can be utilized
    in specialized power plants to produce power more efficiently.
  - Labs take power in order to produce advanced materials. This allows you to build
    more advanced buildings.
  - The demolition tool can destroy buildings and cables that you have placed. You
    will be refunded 50% of the money cost for the building. However, houses may
    not be demolished.
  - You can move any building that you could demolish. With the move tool, you can
    change where on the planet a building is placed. However, you can not move it
    to a different planet.
  - When building, a cable will automatically be placed between the new building
    and the previous one. This includes when you change building types.
  - If you want to quickly build cables while building, you can click on a different
    building to make it the start point for the cable that will be built upon placing
    a new building.
  - The cable connection tool will connect buildings with cables. It requires no
    interruptions, and only has so much range. You can chain cables as with the chain
    building.
  - Planets all have an innate mass. Placing buildings on a planet increases its
    mass. This causes a planets gravity to increase.
  - When the center of a celestial body falls within the gravity range of another
    planet, it will be pulled towards that other planet.
  - When two planets collide, whichever has the smaller mass will be completely destroyed.
    Meanwhile all buildings on the more massive planet will be destroyed in the process.
  - You can open the menu near the mini map to toggle different views. This allows
    you to turn on/off the solar fields, and gravity fields.
  - In the View Toggles, you can also enable the Grid Group View. This shows you
    which buildings are connected, as well as the total power provided/requested
    by all buildings connected in that grid group.
  - If you click on to select a building, you will see information about it in the
    inspector. If there is enough power in the grid, you can click on the powered
    button to change the buildings powered status.
  - Thrusters will never be automatically powered. If you toggle them on, the planet
    attached will accelerate away from the thruster as long as it remains powered.
